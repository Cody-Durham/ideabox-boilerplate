## Introduction
The Ideabox site allows you to create and save ideas in a grid of sticky-note like cards. Each idea can be starred (favorited), deleted, or commented on, and the ideas are searchable based on their contents and starred status. When you create or update ideas in your browser and later reload your page, your past ideas will reappear in your card grid.
